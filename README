Setup:
The data is too big to keep in the repo so you need to download it 
yourself to use this code.

1) Go to https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge/dataset and download the data
2) mkdir yelp_data
3) mv the tar file into yelp_data
4) untar the file with tar -xvf yelp_dataset_challenge_academic_dataset.tar
5) delete the pdf files
6) rename the reviews file with mv yelp_academic_dataset_review.json reviews.json
