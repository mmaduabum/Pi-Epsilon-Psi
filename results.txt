SVM Random Baseline 5 classes:
	-average accuracy = 0.20

SVM Actual Baseline
	(features: size, first 5 words as glove vectors)
	-average accuracy = 0.29
		===NOTES===
		glove shit is hard to use because all feature vectors need to be same size. 
			-some words dont have gloves, some reviews are longer than others
			-so i tried to use the first few words from the review and glove only thos
				-results not very good (~30%)
		currently trying positve and negative word lists instead of glove
