SVM Random Baseline 5 classes:
	-average accuracy = 0.20

SVM Actual Baseline
	(features: size, first 5 words as glove vectors)
	-average accuracy = 0.29, 0.45
		===NOTES===
		glove shit is hard to use because all feature vectors need to be same size. 
			-some words dont have gloves, some reviews are longer than others
			-so i tried to use the first few words from the review and glove only thos
				-results not very good (~30%)
		currently trying positve and negative word lists instead of glove
			-so using this it gets up to about 45% with this shit but its prettry variable (31-57) 
				on the tiny dataset and the 'small' one takes 1000000000000000 years to run so...
				-K i created a more reasonable dataset (3000) and it runs in about 17 minutes with just
					the 3 features (size, neg words, pos words) and got 44% accuracy

SVM New Model
	(features: size, poswords, negwords) 
	-average accuracy = 0.446 (on tiny)
	-just ran it on very_small.json (64 minutes) and got 36.3% accuracy 
		-problem is the one v all classifiers always return false
			-need better features for it to start working i think
