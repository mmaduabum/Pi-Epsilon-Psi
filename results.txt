SVM Random Baseline 5 classes:
	-average accuracy = 0.20

SVM Actual Baseline
	(features: size, first 5 words as glove vectors)
	-average accuracy = 0.29, 0.45
		===NOTES===
		glove shit is hard to use because all feature vectors need to be same size. 
			-some words dont have gloves, some reviews are longer than others
			-so i tried to use the first few words from the review and glove only thos
				-results not very good (~29%)
		currently trying positve and negative word lists instead of glove
			-so using this it gets up to about 45% with this shit but its prettry variable (31-57) 
				on the tiny dataset and the 'small' one takes 1000000000000000 years to run so...
				-K i created a more reasonable dataset (3000) and it runs in about 17 minutes with just
					the 3 features (size, neg words, pos words) and got 44% accuracy

SVM New Model
	(features: size, poswords, negwords) 
	-average accuracy = 0.446 (on tiny)
	-just ran it on very_small.json (64 minutes) and got 36.3% accuracy 
		-problem is the one v all classifiers always return false
	-After fixing bug: all predictions are 1 or 5 and accuracy is 45%
			-need better features for it to start working i think
	-with glvoe features im getting 16.6% :(
		-goes up to 18% when using glove + size, sentiment word features

	PROGRESS: after fixing the bug, our model on glove features gets 31.9%! (this was on the tiny set. gonna run overnight on small)

NN Random Baseline 5 classes:
	-impossible

NN Actual Baseline
	(features: glove)
	-average accuracy = 0
		-its predicting class 0 everytime for some reason 

	okay so the neural net cant do more than 2 classes. Running it with glove features on 1,2 vs 3,4,5 gets 75% accuracy
		Note: when the cutoff is moved to distinguish between 1,2,3 vs 4,5 the accuracy goes down to 59%
	we cant generate a multiclass baseline. I'm gonna just implement our model

NN New Model
	(features: size, pos, neg)
	-average accuracy = 0.41 (one run on tiny)

	(features: glove + size, pos, meg)
	-average accuracy = 0.407960199005 (one run on tiny) 
							-got 0.274626865672 on a later run
						0.405970149254 (one run on very_small)
						0.275621890547 (run on small.json)  --80 minutes to run

	(features: counts)
		0.11 (one run on tiny)
		0.407 (one run on very_small)
		41% on small. every prediction is the same



PROBLEMS:
-its predicting the same class everytime
	-it was predicting all 5s because that was the most common example
	-after normalizing test data, it predicts 4 every time (actually not sure if its 4, but its the same one every time)
	-after normalizing train data, it still predicts 2 every time. no idea why :(  


features: just size
	-guess 4 every time
features: size and sentiment words
	-guesses 1 most of the time. also guesses 4 and 2 every guess of 2 is incorrect
features: just sentiment words:
	-guesses 1s, 2s, and 5s only (36% overall accuracy)
features: sentiment words, exclaim, d_exclaim
	-guesses everything except 4 (36% overall accuracy)  (not many 3s, but some)
features: size, sentiment words, exclaim, d_exclaim
	-almost all 1s, some 4s and 2s. again all 2s are wrong
features: sentiment words, money feature
	-everything except 4, mostly 5s, few 3s (36% overall)
features
	-
